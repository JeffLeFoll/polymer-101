## Workshop goal
The goal of this workshop is to discover Polymer 2 and the PWA principles by building a Blog site.  
The REST API Backend is provided so we will not cover this part (source code available here on [github.com/JeffLeFoll/polymer-101-backend](https://github.com/JeffLeFoll/polymer-101-backend)).

### Objectives
In this workshop you will learn to:
- init a new Polymer 2 PWA
- create pages & components
- use the Fetch API and the iron-ajax component
- use the app-route component to navigate in your SPA 
- ...

### API
The REST API is located here [https://polymer-101-workshop.cleverapps.io/api/blogpost](https://polymer-101-workshop.cleverapps.io/api/blogpost) (unavailable outside workshop event, check the source code if you need it).  
The API exposes the folowing ressources: 
```
GET    / 
GET    /api/blogpost 
POST   /api/blogpost
PUT    /api/blogpost 
GET    /api/blogpost/:id
DELETE /api/blogpost/:id

``` 

## Step 1 - Project init: 
**When the Polymer Start Kit will be release**  
Using your terminal of choice, create a folder `polymer-workshop`.  
Then in this folder execute the following command : `polymer init` and select the `Polymer 2 Start Kit` when prompted.

**Meanwhile**  
Using git, in your terminal of choice, execute the following command:  
`git clone -b 2.0-preview http://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit.git ./polymer-workshop`, it will checkout the polymer 2 starter kit in the `polymer-workshop` folder, you can then remove the `.git` / `.github` folders.

## Step 2 - Discovering the PSK

## Step 3 - The langing page  
We will start by creating a page that list all the Blog Post's and limit the article displayed to 140 characters.
