# polymer-101
Project for a mini "workshop" to discover Polymer  

## Step 0 - Setup:  
For this workshop you need to have the following tools :
- Node.js (6.x ou 8.x)
- Polymer-cli (npm install -g polymer-cli / yarn global add polymer-cli)
- An IDE (Webstorm, Atom or Visual Studio Code [with the Polymer-IDE extension])
- Google Chrome ( stable or later) or Chromium
- Lighthouse plug-in for Chrome

## Step 1 - Project init: 
**When the Polymer Start Kit will be release**  
Using your terminal of choice, create a folder `polymer-workshop`.  
Then in this folder execute the following command : `polymer init` and select the `Polymer 2 Start Kit` when prompted.

**Meanwhile**  
Using git, in your terminal of choice, execute the following command:  
`git clone -b 2.0-preview http://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit.git ./polymer-workshop`, it will checkout the polymer 2 starter kit in the `polymer-workshop` folder, you can then remove the `.git` / `.github` folders.

## Step 2 - Discovering the PSK

## Step 3 - Workshop goal
The goal of this workshop is to discover Polymer 2 and the PWA principles by building a Blog site.  
The REST API Backend is provided so we will not cover this part (source code available here on [github.com/JeffLeFoll/polymer-101-backend](https://github.com/JeffLeFoll/polymer-101-backend)).

### Objectives
In this workshop we will build :
- a page listing all blog posts (date, title, 140 first article characters).
